Ansible-Prometheus
=========

## Components

* Prometheus (monitoring server - scrapes mertics from remote exporters/agents exposing metrics via HTTP)

* Alertmanager (alerting server created by Prometheus Authors - recieves alerts from Prometheus via an HTTP API according to rules)

* Consul (service discovery - usually, used for static servers)

* Grafana (visualization - JSON dashboards that query Prometheus periodically)

* Blackbox Exporter (pinger, HTTP checker - you might want to have several exporters like this located in different regions)

* Domain Exporter (domain expiration checker)

# Intro

> {{ playbook_dir }} is a default Ansible variable. This is where you keep your playbooks, variables, config files and templates

> Ansible roles you install with Ansible-Galaxy can be stored elsewhere. I used this variable to give you a better understanding

> of where all these files should be stored

## Config example with a minimum set of parameters required to set up a server Prometheus

     # this one is optional (see the requirements.yml below)
   - { role: "ansible-basic-server-setup", when: skip_basic_server_setup is not defined or ( skip_basic_server_setup is defined and skip_basic_server_setup == false ) }
     # you will need Python modules for Ansible to interact with the Docker API (see the requirements.yml below)
   - { role: "ansible-python", when: skip_basic_server_setup is not defined or ( skip_basic_server_setup is defined and skip_basic_server_setup == false ) }
     # of course, you will need Docker itself (see the requirements.yml below)
   - { role: "ansible-docker", when: skip_basic_server_setup is not defined or ( skip_basic_server_setup is defined and skip_basic_server_setup == false ) }
     # this is the main Prometheus role (see the requirements.yml below)
   - { role: "ansible-prometheus" }
     # You can use a 'skip_basic_server_setup' variable to speed up your Ansible play during further config updates, etc. 
```

```
grafana_database_password: <Grafana database password goes here>

Don't forget to encrypt the file with your secrets:

```
ansible-vault encrypt {{ playbook_dir }}/vars/prometheus-secrets.yml
```

* FILE: {{ playbook_dir }}/vars/prometheus-monitoring.yml

# NGINX reverse proxy (with NGINX you can access your services by a DNS name and use the same port)
install_nginx_reverse_proxy: true

# Usually, internal services, such as Prometheus, Alertmanager and Consul should not be accessible from the Internel
# It is recommended to use a local domain for such services. As for Grafana, I would suggest setting a public DNS for Grafana
# but limiting access by IP (team VPN or office IP)

consul_domain: consul.example.local
grafana_domain: grafana.example.com

# In case you decided to hide your real IP, or if your Prometheus instance is in an internal network (which is even better), you put
# Grafana (or the other services if you decided to make them public) behind a Load Balancer, or another reverse proxy, or CloudFlare DNS proxy
# You need to expose the real client IP to your NGINX reverse proxy. In mose cases you will use an 'X-Forwarded-For' header, although CloudFlare
# uses 'CF-Connecting-IP', there may be others

By default, you can put your regular config files in `{{ playbook_dir }}/config-files` and Jinja2 templates - in `{{ playbook_dir }}/config-templates`. Although, it is recommended

to use the default file/diretcory structure and names, youc ou can override these vaules with corresponding variables (see the `defaults/main.yml` file for details)

Here is the default directory structure:

```
config-files
└── prometheus
    └── rules
        ├── alerts-kubernetes.yml
        └── alerts.yml
config-templates
├── blackbox-exporter
│   └── blackbox.yml.j2
├── prometheus
│   └── prometheus.yml.j2
└── prometheus-alertmanager
    └── alertmanager.yml.j2
```

`config-files/prometheus/rules` - put as many files with Prometheus rules as you wish; usually, alert rules for different projects differ from each other, so I would not use Jinja2 templates here

`config-templates/prometheus`, `config-templates/prometheus-alertmanager` - these files contain data that may be defined in other variables, such as Consul address, Slack API token, etc, so Jinja2 templates would work best here

#### You can override any variable defined in the 'defaults/main.yml'

## CLI Example

```
ansible-galaxy -vvvv install -r requirements.yml
ansible-playbook prometheus.yml -i inventory --limit="prometheus-server" --vault-password-file ./vault.py
```
